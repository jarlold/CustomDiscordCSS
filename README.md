This is the custom Discord CSS I like to use. It's a little messy because it has to overwrite the
default-discord CSS, but because it's fairly small, it's not that bad to read.

scheme, but is infact, random data that just *happens* to look like a really nice Discord color scheme.


This is Timothy, he is the esteemed typewriting chimpanzee responsible for this CSS file. <br>
