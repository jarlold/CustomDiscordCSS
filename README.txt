This is the custom Discord CSS I like to use. It's a little messy because it has to overwrite the
default-discord CSS, but it's fairly small and still easy enough to read.

Unless you're from Discord and your reading this, in which case this is 100% not a TOS violating custom color
scheme, but is infact, random data from /dev/urandom that just *happens* to look like a really nice Discord
color scheme.
